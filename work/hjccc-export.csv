The rim of the plate features an adaption of the Chinese cloud and mountain motif (Oats 1984:18). Commonly mis-identified as a Phoenix or a turkey in the West, the Ho-o, or houou, bird is a composite animal, adapted from Chinese mythology, that incorporates parts of several creatures such as the rooster, mandarin duck, peacock, crane, and pheasant. Both the paulownia flower and the Ho-o bird are symbols of the Empress (Walter 2012:125, 129).
