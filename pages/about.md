# About {{ site.title }}

The Historical Japanese Ceramic Comparative Collection (HJCCC) contains digital photographs and resources for identifying and describing Japanese ceramics manufactured during the Meiji and Taisho eras, or roughly the nineteenth to early twentieth centuries.  The intent of this collection is to provide archaeologists and other researchers with comparative examples of historical Japanese ceramics that are commonly found on archaeological sites in the American West.  Many of the ceramics in this collection belonged to a diverse group of Japanese laborers, families, and American citizens who arrived in North America between approximately 1880 and 1924 and who are collectively known as Issei.  As a material remnant of daily life, these ceramics contribute to studies examining the experiences of Issei and their descendants.  

The ceramics depicted in this collection come from multiple collections.  Information about these collections and links to the curation facilities that house them can be found on the Resources page.  The Resources page also provides bibliographic information for the references cited in this collection.  An overview of the classification system used to describe the ceramics in this collection can be viewed by following the Typology link.  The Glossary page contains translations of the Japanese terminology used to describe vessel attributes, as well as an overview of Japanese eras with date ranges.
